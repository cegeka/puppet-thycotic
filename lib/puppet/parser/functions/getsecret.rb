# The 'getsecret' function uses the Thycotic Secret Server API to retrieve
# private data (passwords, private keys, etc) and returns it to the caller
# as string data.
#
# For setup and usage instructions please see the README in the root of
# the module. Very basic usage instructions are here:
#
# Example usage:
#   $aws_creds = getsecret('539820', 'secret_name')
#
# Returns:
#   $aws_creds = 'foo'

require 'socket'

# We will store our single Thycotic object here once its created
# in an INSTANCE scoped variable.
@thycotic = nil

# Store a reference to where we loaded our last configuration file
# from. This is used to re-configure our Thycotic object in the event
# that someone calls the getsecret() function with a unique config
# filename. For example:
#
# getsecret(123, 'password')
# ...
# getsecret(234, 'password', '/path/to/corp/thycotic.conf')

  # However, if a custom_config file parameter is supplied, then we use that
